Brian (en-GB, standard/neural)

Male, British, pretty neutral timbre.

Slow him down and drop pitch slightly → very Marvin-ready.

Arthur (en-GB, standard)

Also male British; different character, can work if Brian feels too “newsreader”.

Geraint (en-GB-WLS, standard)

Male Welsh. Slightly rougher character; if you want “tired older robot from Cardiff,” this is nice.

Secondary picks (US but deadpan-able)

Matthew (en-US, neural / generative)

Smooth, neutral male voice. With slow rate + lower pitch + less expressive text, you get a nicely flat affect.

Stephen (en-US, generative)
